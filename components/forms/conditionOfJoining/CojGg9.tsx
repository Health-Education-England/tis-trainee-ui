                On accepting an offer to join a training programme in{" "}
                <b>{progName}</b>, I agree to meet the following requirements
                throughout the duration of the programme:
              </SummaryList.Value>
            </SummaryList.Row>
            <ul>
              <li>
                I will always have at the forefront of my clinical and
                professional practice the principles of Good Medical Practice
                for the benefit of safe patient care. I am aware that Good
                Medical Practice requires me to keep my knowledge and skills up
                to date throughout my working life, and to regularly take part
                in educational activities that maintain and further develop my
                capabilities, competence and performance.
              </li>
              <li>
                As a doctor in training, I will make myself familiar with my
                curriculum and meet the requirements set within it. I will use
                training resources available optimally to develop my knowledge,
                skills and attitudes to the standards set by the relevant
                curriculum. This will include additional requirements as set out
                by the relevant curricula.
              </li>
              <li>
                I will ensure that the care I give to patients is responsive to
                their needs, and that it is equitable, respects human rights,
                challenges discrimination, promotes equality, and maintains the
                dignity of patients and carers.
              </li>
              <li>
                I will ensure I treat my clinical and non-clinical colleagues
                with respect, promoting a culture of teamworking across all
                professions working in healthcare.
              </li>
              <li>
                I will maintain my General Medical Council (GMC) registration
                with a licence to practise (even if temporarily out of
                programme). For all trainees, failure to do so may result in a
                police investigation, immediate exclusion from employment and
                referral to the GMC. Failure to do so may also result in my
                removal from the training programme.
              </li>
              <li>
                I understand my responsibilities within revalidation, that I
                must declare my full scope of practice (including locum
                positions) and that I will provide evidence for all areas of
                activity using the Form R part B to inform the ARCP panel and RO
                of the full scope of practice. I understand that my Responsible
                Officer is the Postgraduate Dean or Medical Director (NIMDTA and
                HEIW where the Medical Director is the RO) and that Health
                Education England (HEE), NHS Education for Scotland (NES), HEIW
                or the Northern Ireland Medical and Dental Training Agency
                (NIMDTA) is my designated body.
              </li>
              <li>
                If starting at F1 level, I will have achieved a primary medical
                qualification as recognised by the GMC and obtained provisional
                registration by the time I am scheduled to commence the F1 year.
                I understand that I will need to obtain full registration with
                the GMC in advance of commencing as a F2 doctor.
              </li>
              <li>
                I will ensure that when carrying out work in a general practice
                setting, I am on the GP Performers List (specialty trainees
                only).
              </li>
              <li>
                I agree that I will only assume responsibility for or perform
                procedures in areas where I have sufficient knowledge,
                experience and expertise as set out by the GMC, my employers and
                my clinical supervisors.
              </li>
              <li>
                I will have adequate insurance and indemnity cover, in
                accordance with GMC guidance. I understand that personal
                indemnity cover is also strongly recommended.
              </li>
              <li>
                I will inform my Responsible Officer, HEE/NES/HEIW/NIMDTA and my
                employer immediately if I am currently under investigation by
                the police, the GMC/General Dental Council (GDC), NHS Resolution
                (formerly the National Clinical Assessment Service) or other
                regulatory body, and I will inform my Responsible Officer and
                HEE/NES/HEIW/NIMDTA if I am under investigation by my employer.
                I also agree to share information on the progress of any
                investigations.
              </li>
              <li>
                I will inform my Responsible Officer, HEE/NES/HEIW/NIMDTA and my
                employer immediately if the MTPS or GMC/GDC place any conditions
                (interim or otherwise) on my licence, or if my name is suspended
                or erased/removed from the Medical or Dental Register/Performers
                List, or if NHS England take action to restrict my ability to
                work as a doctor or a dentist.
              </li>
              <li>
                I will provide my employer and HEE/NES/HEIW/NIMDTA with adequate
                notice as per GMC guidance/contract requirements if I wish to
                resign from my post/training programme.
              </li>
              <li>
                I will maintain a prescribed connection with
                HEE/NES/HEIW/NIMDTA, work in an approved practice setting until
                my GMC revalidation date (this applies to all doctors granted
                full registration after 2 June 2014) and comply with all
                requirements regarding the GMC revalidation process.
              </li>
              <li>
                I will ensure that I comply with the standards required from
                doctors when engaging with social media, and I will adhere to my
                employerâ€™s policy on social media and GMC guidance.
              </li>
              <li>
                I acknowledge that as an employee in a healthcare organisation,
                I accept the responsibility to abide by and work effectively as
                an employee for that organisation; this includes familiarity
                with policies (including absence policies), participating in
                pre-employment checks and occupational health assessments,
                employer and departmental inductions, and workplace-based
                appraisal as well as educational appraisal. I acknowledge and
                agree to the need to share information about my performance as a
                doctor in training with other organisations (e.g. employers,
                medical schools, the GMC, Colleges/training bodies involved in
                my training) and with the Postgraduate Dean on a regular basis.
